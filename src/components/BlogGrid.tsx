      <h2>The Art of the Smash</h2>
      <p>The smash is badminton's most powerful shot, often winning points instantly. However, power isn't everything – technique is key.</p>

      <h3>Positioning and Preparation</h3>
      <p>Get behind the shuttle early. Your body should be sideways to the net, with your non-racket arm pointing at the shuttle for balance and guidance.</p>

      <h3>The Strike</h3>
      <p>Explode upwards, rotating your hips and shoulders. Snap your wrist at the point of impact to generate maximum speed. Aim steeply downwards.</p>
      
      <h3>Recovery</h3>
      <p>Follow through and immediately return to your base position, ready for the next shot.</p>

      <h2>The Foundation of Snooker</h2>
      <p>A consistent cue action is the bedrock of any good snooker player's game. It ensures that you strike the cue ball exactly where you intend.</p>

      <h3>The Stance</h3>
      <p>Your stance should be stable and comfortable. Keep your chin close to the cue and ensure your bridge arm is straight.</p>

      <h3>The Grip</h3>
      <p>Visualise holding a bird – firm enough so it doesn't fly away, but loose enough not to crush it. A relaxed grip allows for a smoother delivery.</p>

      <h3>Follow Through</h3>
      <p>Don't stop the cue when you hit the white. drive the cue through the ball for better control and power.</p>

      <h2>Endurance is Key</h2>
      <p>Modern football requires high-intensity running combined with technical skill. Fitness is just as important as ball control.</p>

      <h3>Interval Training</h3>
      <p>High-Intensity Interval Training (HIIT) mimics the stop-start nature of a football match. Mix sprints with jogging recovery periods.</p>

      <h3>Core Strength</h3>
      <p>A strong core improves balance and stability, making you harder to knock off the ball.</p>

      <h3>Nutrition and Hydration</h3>
      <p>Fuel your body with the right carbohydrates before a match and stay hydrated to maintain concentration levels.</p>

      <h2>The Batting Mindset</h2>
      <p>Batting is about playing one ball at a time. Switch on when the bowler runs in, and switch off between deliveries to conserve mental energy.</p>

      <h3>Handling Pressure</h3>
      <p>Focus on your routine. Breathe deeply and visualize your success. Trust your training.</p>

      <h3>Staying in the Present</h3>
      <p>Don't worry about the previous ball or the outcome of the match. Focus entirely on the next delivery.</p>
